Pirkolator
==========

Easy to use, portable, scalable, and fast distributed pub/sub in Java.

The Pirkolator was designed to bring the data to the analytic to the user. Using the Pirkolator, a developer can focus on delivering something that works, instead of figuring out how to get data, save data, or distribute results.

The Pirkolator engine allows us to attack BigData by providing a simple, intuitive, and flexible infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to deploy analytics to distributed compute platforms, like Amazon Web Services. It allows us to also implement analytics that realize the gains of parallel computations.
